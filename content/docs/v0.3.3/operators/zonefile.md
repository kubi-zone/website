## Procedure

Whenever a [Zone](../../custom-resources/zone/) referenced by a [ZoneFile](../custom-resources/zonefile/) changes,
the operator rebuilds the [RFC1035](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1035#section-5)-compatible text representation
of the zone, and creates/updates the `ConfigMap` with the new data.
